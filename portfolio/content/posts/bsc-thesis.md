## **Project Overview |** Inequality in Access to Tertiary Education

![tiny]({filename}/img/bsc.png)


The aim of my Bachelor dissertation project was to examine how spatial and socioeconomic factors shape inequalities in access to postsecondary education in the Latin American country El Salvador. The study conducts a **logistic regression analysis with multiple predictors** using data from the 2015 Salvadoran household survey Encuesta de Hogares de Propósitos Múltiples (EHPM). To include **spatial context** the number of accessible postsecondary institutions and study programs in different time radii are calculated.

I conducted the research for [Consciente El Salvador](www.consciente.ch) - a NGO I've helped building up since 2012 - to help us adjust our studentship programme for students from remote areas.

## Methods

- Calculation of number of accessible postsecondary institutions and study programs in different time radii using road network data (ArcGIS)
- Logistic Regression Model with multiple predictors - including travel time radii - using El Salvador Houshold Survey data (see **Stata code** in my [github repository](https://github.com/liviajakob/education-el-salvador))
