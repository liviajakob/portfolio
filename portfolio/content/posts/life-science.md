**Project Partner:** [Zeilenwerk](http://www.zeilenwerk.ch/), [Life Science Cluster Basel](http://www.lifesciencesbasel.com/)

&nbsp;

This is a data visualisation project I was working on in 2016 and 2017 (together with the firm Zeilenwerk) about the life sciences industry in Basel. It originated from an ongoing research project of the group of Economic Geography at the University of Bern, where I was working from 2015 to 2017.

&nbsp;

The online visualisation illustrates the size and genealogy of the Basel life sciences industry cluster. We illustrate the importance of entrepreneurship in the emergence and growth of clusters. The graphic links companies to their parent firms when at least one of the founders of a firm has worked at the parent firm immediately prior to starting the new company. I gathered the data through a triangulation of various sources (corporate websites, LinkedIn, Moneyhouse, etc.).
