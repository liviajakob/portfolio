## **Project Overview** | Pay or Die? Prison or Cemetery?

[![tiny]({filename}/img/storymap4.png)]({filename}/img/storymap4.png)
This data visualisation project tells the story of street gangs in El Salvador with interactive and static maps and graphics. It is a story that has been told many times before, especially within the last few months. And in my opinion the story has too often been told from a wrong perspective. 

With my Storymap I aim to reduce prejudices and to shed a different light on the topic by telling the story in a different way. The storyline starts off by giving the reader a wider context of worldwide homicide rates. It then zooms into El Salvador and gives a background and history explaining the high homicide rates. After that, the appearance of the criminal gangs - Las Maras - are portrayed from two perspectives: **Pay or Die** describes the perspective of El Salvadoran citizens who are daily exposed to violence. The section **Prison or Cemetery** portrays the perspective of young people finding a sense of belonging and protection against the police in one of the street gangs.

**Exlaining the history of the mara**: Six static maps showing the history and genesis of the mara. The maps were created with photo editing software using the same map cut-out for each map as a background to make it seem as though only the arrows are fading in and out.
