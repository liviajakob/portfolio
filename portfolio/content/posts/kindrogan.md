## **Project Overview |** Webbased Tourist Guide for Kindrogan

**Role within group:** Project Manager, Webdesign and Webprogramming

**Prize:** We won the price for the best project and presentation out of 10 groups.

&nbsp;

This was a project during a fieldtrip to Kindrogan (Scotland) where we collected data in the field and programmed a local tourist guide for the area.

The website ([www.kindrogan.geo-blog.com](www.kindrogan.geo-blog.com)) displays geospatial information, photographs and descriptions of selected points of interest through an interface centred on graphical elements. This was achieved by gathering data from a variety of sources and designing maps and a website guided by design principles to make navigation intuitive and simple. The design was followed up with user testing and subsequent improvements.
